The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND å¼‚å¸¸ very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability. And the love of mischief, so that the mercenary group of people have a headache. But at the same time, Lina Shah was slightly emotional, and even when she was a little bit of trouble, she even felt pitiful. No one knows what she experienced before coming to the Garon Mercenary No one has ever seen what she is behind that smiley face.

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path. Keep Hugo alive long enough and you will eventually reach the destination and victory!","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/header.jpg?t=1651033778","","","jhenley123@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,1,"",0,0,"There is a small amount of mildly offensive language.",0,0,0,0,"Julian Henley","Julian Henley","Single-player","Action,Casual","Action,Casual,Arcade,Pixel Graphics,2D,Cartoony,Funny,Linear,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_3554f50d7f2b332e4dd5544aaea9721424eb3c27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_77f06fc8e4502728f42cd92855a089303f282b01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_449d5dc65de5556cf6a4751d88a45cc1fe2a8db6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_b61f9f1d33f7a02025dd47ccae811f5a581c47b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_9690b616cae80d95cd31c91d01e9e50819e73230.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_17e8964a5be9ce7a3c3cb031ad5882d565d63813.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_50141b7333cba15cdc983aa2806b9590db466131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_f393400e7addb1cfdac84fde14e3d6cd93d41f79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759250/movie_max.mp4?t=1566330531"

Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world thatâ€™s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each playerâ€™s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, theyâ€™ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every playerâ€™s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factionsâ€™ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future weâ€™ll be adding: ãƒ»More TSFs to fight in. ãƒ»Voice chat ãƒ»Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346","https://www.project-mikhail.com","https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/","support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp",True,False,False,0,"",0,328,253,"",0,563,"",670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.","aNCHOR Inc.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"																																																																																																																																
1128520,"Rezist: Tower Defense","Sep 26, 2019","0 - 20000",0,0,0.99,0,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system â€” your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761","","","hydrargyrum2.0@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,8,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"SparkGames","SparkGames","Single-player","Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189"
