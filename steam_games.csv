Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table	 with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.

Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission	 Read mission tactical maps	 Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them	 Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game	 Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars	 Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences	 Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War	 Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling	 Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself	 Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons	 We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: â–¶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). â–¶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. â–¶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. â–¶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. â–¶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: â–¶ Black for stationary floors/ground	 â–¶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around	 â–¶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of	 â–¶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: â–¶ â€œCreateâ€ mode, to create your own worlds	 â–¶ â€œPlayâ€ mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in â€œcampaignâ€ mode (worlds selected by our team), or in â€œcatalogueâ€ mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: â–¶ â€œEscapeâ€: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game	 â–¶ â€œDestructionâ€: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] â–¶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. â–¶ Choose vivid colors. â–¶ Take pictures under good lighting.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/header.jpg?t=1502354684","","http://www.draw-your-game.com/","contact@zerokcm.fr",True,False,False,0,"",0,18,50,"",43,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Zero One","Zero One","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Casual","Casual,Platformer,Hand-drawn","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_1678380950ebac84202055083b6203c8e8e0163e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_2c500bf228b7eb77b417e3a33d923ad2a808f852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_bff6bdf44b1b291473520cc136afbca3f4d50e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_d94d37ed784c6f52cb31b795e2c364ed97f45851.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_9b456ef2f86761bc6b63544d272516638efbc09a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_105e22f97a7148e33bd0d6b0791547a3bb58cbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_caf80ca9da235d21c2f9e9c606aec64a0661dfd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_99272a04bf3261225ea88048764790614e8abd0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689941/movie_max.mp4?t=1501794251"

Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, â€˜Unhappy Ever Afterâ€™ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.","['English']","[]","â€œUnhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mindâ€™s imagination!â€ 8/10 â€“ OPN","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559","","http://warpedtales.weebly.com/","the.warped.tales@gmail.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,16,10,"",0,0,"",218,0,218,0,"Warped Tales","Warped Tales","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252"

Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight â€“ necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world â€“ Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930â€™s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976","http://www.deadfall-game.com/","","support@quanticlab.com",True,False,True,53,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,1716,628,"",50,1140,"",324,0,431,0,"The Farm 51","THQ Nordic","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND å¼‚å¸¸ very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability. And the love of mischief, so that the mercenary group of people have a headache. But at the same time, Lina Shah was slightly emotional, and even when she was a little bit of trouble, she even felt pitiful. No one knows what she experienced before coming to the Garon Mercenary No one has ever seen what she is behind that smiley face.

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path. Keep Hugo alive long enough and you will eventually reach the destination and victory!","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/header.jpg?t=1651033778","","","jhenley123@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,1,"",0,0,"There is a small amount of mildly offensive language.",0,0,0,0,"Julian Henley","Julian Henley","Single-player","Action,Casual","Action,Casual,Arcade,Pixel Graphics,2D,Cartoony,Funny,Linear,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_3554f50d7f2b332e4dd5544aaea9721424eb3c27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_77f06fc8e4502728f42cd92855a089303f282b01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_449d5dc65de5556cf6a4751d88a45cc1fe2a8db6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_b61f9f1d33f7a02025dd47ccae811f5a581c47b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_9690b616cae80d95cd31c91d01e9e50819e73230.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_17e8964a5be9ce7a3c3cb031ad5882d565d63813.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_50141b7333cba15cdc983aa2806b9590db466131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_f393400e7addb1cfdac84fde14e3d6cd93d41f79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759250/movie_max.mp4?t=1566330531"

Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world thatâ€™s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each playerâ€™s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, theyâ€™ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every playerâ€™s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factionsâ€™ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future weâ€™ll be adding: ãƒ»More TSFs to fight in. ãƒ»Voice chat ãƒ»Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346","https://www.project-mikhail.com","https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/","support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp",True,False,False,0,"",0,328,253,"",0,563,"",670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.","aNCHOR Inc.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"																																																																																																																																
1128520,"Rezist: Tower Defense","Sep 26, 2019","0 - 20000",0,0,0.99,0,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system â€” your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761","","","hydrargyrum2.0@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,8,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"SparkGames","SparkGames","Single-player","Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189"

Master and summon 15 different spirits with unique abilities. 15+ hours of story and gameplay. SUMMARY In a regional city in the present day, Sayaka Mimuro manages her family's Shinto shrine on behalf of her absent parents. Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herselfâ€”she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara â€œNothing is impossible if you give it your all.â€ A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situationâ€”even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date.
