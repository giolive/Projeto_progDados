Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table	 with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.

When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission	 Read mission tactical maps	 Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them	 Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game	 Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars	 Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences	 Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War	 Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling	 Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself	 Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons	 We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: â–¶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). â–¶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. â–¶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. â–¶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. â–¶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: â–¶ Black for stationary floors/ground	 â–¶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around	 â–¶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of	 â–¶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: â–¶ â€œCreateâ€ mode, to create your own worlds	 â–¶ â€œPlayâ€ mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in â€œcampaignâ€ mode (worlds selected by our team), or in â€œcatalogueâ€ mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: â–¶ â€œEscapeâ€: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game	 â–¶ â€œDestructionâ€: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.
